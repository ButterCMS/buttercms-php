# ButterCMS PHP API Wrapper
This README contains instructions on how to develop updates or fixes to this wrapper locally.

## Local Development
The `/tests` folder is set up to make local development and testing a little easier.
Running the following commands will use the latest commit of the code as the package.
From there you can simply edit the files and run the test to check updates.

```
cd tests
composer install
php main.php
```
